                <strong>Technology</strong> is the result of accumulated knowledge and application of skills, methods,
                and processes used in industrial production and scientific research. Technology is embedded in the
                operation of all machines, with or without detailed knowledge of their function, for the intended
                purpose of an organization. The technologies of society consist of what is known as systems. Systems
                operate by obtaining an input, altering this input through what is known as a process, and then
                producing an outcome that achieves the intended purpose of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The earliest and simplest form of technology is the development of knowledge that leads to the
                application of basic tools. The prehistoric invention of shaped stone tools and the discovery of how to
                control fire increased the sources of food that were available to human beings. The invention of the
                wheel led to the travelling technologies that helped humans to further increase the yield of food
                production, travel in less time, and exchange information and raw materials faster. Humanity then
                progressed to the development of the printing press, the telephone, the computer, and then the
                Internet.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology"

                <strong>Freethought (sometimes spelled free thought)</strong> is an epistemological viewpoint which
                holds that beliefs should not be formed on the basis of authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma, and
                that beliefs should instead be reached by other methods such as logic, reason, and empirical
                observation. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a <strong>freethinker</strong> is "a person who
                forms their own ideas and opinions rather than accepting those of other people, especially in religious
                teaching." In some contemporary thought in particular, free thought is strongly tied with rejection of
                traditional social or religious belief systems.The cognitive application of free thought is known as
                "freethinking", and practitioners of free thought are known as "freethinkers".Modern freethinkers
                consider free thought to be a natural freedom from all negative and illusive thoughts acquired from
                society..
            </p>

            <p>
                The term first came into use in the 17th century in order to refer to people who inquired into the basis
                of traditional beliefs which were often accepted unquestioningly. Today, freethinking is most closely
                linked with deism, secularism, atheism, agnosticism, humanism, anti-clericalism, and religious critique.
                The Oxford English Dictionary defines freethinking as, "The free exercise of reason in matters of
                religious belief, unrestrained by deference to authority; the adoption of the principles of a
                free-thinker." Freethinkers hold that knowledge should be grounded in facts, scientific inquiry, and
                logic. The skeptical application of science implies freedom from the intellectually limiting effects of
                confirmation bias, cognitive bias, conventional wisdom, popular culture, urban myth, prejudice, or
                sectarianism.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought"

                This list of <strong>life sciences</strong> comprises the branches of science that involve the
                scientific study of life – such as microorganisms, plants, and animals including human beings. This
                science is one of the two major branches of natural science, the other being physical science, which is
                concerned with non-living matter. Biology is the overall natural science that studies life, with the
                other life sciences as its sub-disciplines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, zoology is the study of animals,
                while botany is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life
                forms, such as anatomy and genetics. Some focus on the micro-scale (e.g. molecular biology,
                biochemistry) other on larger scales (e.g. cytology, immunology, ethology, pharmacy, ecology). Another
                major branch of life sciences involves understanding the mind – neuroscience. Life sciences discoveries
                are helpful in improving the quality and standard of life and have applications in health, agriculture,
                medicine, and the pharmaceutical and food science industries... <a

                <strong>Physical science</strong> is a branch of natural science that studies non-living systems, in
                contrast to life science. It in turn has many branches, each referred to as a "physical science",
                together called the "physical sciences".
            </p>
            <aside>
                Physical science can be described as all of the following:
                <p>A branch of science (a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of
                    testable explanations and predictions about the universe).</p>

                <p>A branch of natural science – natural science is a major branch of science that tries to explain and
                    predict nature's phenomena, based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypotheses must be
                    verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory. Validity, accuracy, and social
                    mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst
                    the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into two main
                    branches: life science (for example biology) and physical science. Each of these branches, and all
                    of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences</p>
            </aside>
            <p><strong>Branches of Physical Science</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Physics</strong>-natural and physical science could involve the study of matter and its motion
                through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. More broadly, it is the
                general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves.</p>
            <p><strong>Astronomy</strong>-study of celestial objects (such as stars, galaxies, planets, moons,
                asteroids, comets and nebulae), the physics, chemistry, and evolution of such objects, and phenomena
                that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth, including supernovae explosions, gamma-ray bursts, and
                cosmic microwave background radiation.</p>
            <p><strong>Chemistry</strong>-studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter.In this
                realm, chemistry deals with such topics as the properties of individual atoms, the manner in which atoms
                form chemical bonds in the formation of compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular
                forces to give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical
                reactions to form different substances.</p>
            <p><strong>Earth science</strong>-all-embracing term referring to the fields of science dealing with planet
                Earth. Earth science is the study of how the natural environment (ecosphere or Earth system) works and
                how it evolved to its current state. It includes the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere,
                and biosphere.
            </p>

            <p><strong>General principles of the physical sciences</strong></p>
            <p>
                Principle – law or rule that has to be, or usually is to be followed, or can be desirably followed, or
                is an inevitable consequence of something, such as the laws observed in nature or the way that a system
                is constructed. The principles of such a system are understood by its users as the essential
                characteristics of the system, or reflecting system's designed purpose, and the effective operation or
                use of which would be impossible if any one of the principles was to be ignored.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Basic principles of physics</strong></p>
            <p>
                Physics – branch of science that studies matter and its motion through space and time, along with
                related concepts such as energy and force. Physics is one of the "fundamental sciences" because the
                other natural sciences (like biology, geology etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of
                physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature
                govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or
                the subatomic particles) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_physical_science"
