            Science isn't the easiest endeavor you can undertake. Sure, the rewards are tremendous: you can wind up
            understanding any phenomenon in the Universe as well (or better) than any human has ever understood it
            before. But on your way there, you're going to have to do some of the most difficult work you've ever done.
            It isn't just mathematical and scientific work, either, but internal work on your own psyche. You'll need to
            learn how to be wrong.

                Ethan was born in New York City as the son of a Jewish postal worker. He did his undergrad at
                Northwestern, taught public school in Houston, Texas and Los Angeles, California, before moving to
                Florida, </p>
            <p>where he got his PhD in theoretical astrophysics at the University of Florida. After that, he moved to
                Madison, Wisconsin, where he taught at the University of Wisconsin, ate too much cheese, and also met
                his life partner, Jamie. </p>
            <p>After working in astrophysics research at the University of Arizona and starting the world-renowned
                science blog, Starts With A Bang, he moved from the hellish desert to rain-soaked Portland in 2008. </p>
            <p>Since then, he's been a professor at the University of Portland and Lewis & Clark College, grown a
                nationally renowned beard and mustache, got invited to join a circus and probably drank more beer than a
                healthy person should. He currently works as the head curator at Trapit, and can't wait to tell you a
                little bit more about the Universe.</p>

            From the distant Universe, light has traveled for some 10.7 billion years from distant <strong>galaxy
                MACSJ2129-1</strong> , lensed, distorted and magnified by the foreground clusters imaged here. The most
            distant galaxies appear redder because their light is redshifted by the expansion of the Universe, which
            helps explain what we measure as Hubble's law.

            No one comes into a scientific field already knowing all the answers; that's why we do the science in the
            first place. When you're just learning it, you put an incomplete number of puzzle pieces together, and your
            incomplete picture is usually incorrect. Or at least, less correct than the best picture. This means it's up
            to you to challenge your assumptions, revise your internal beliefs, and draw superior conclusions. The
            reward, if you can make it, is not just a better understanding, but the lesson of how to be wrong, and how
            to be better in the future.

            IBM's Four Qubit Square Circuit, a pioneering advance in computations, could lead to computers powerful
            enough to simulate an entire Universe. But the field of quantum computation is still in its infancy.

            It's a lesson that goes far beyond science, and can be applied to all areas of our lives. Imagine what the
            world could be like if we all did it.
