            I have a love-hate relationship with farmers. I have a great deal of respect for the enterprise and for
            those who dedicate their lives to it. But, I also become annoyed at the culture in which modern American
            farming embeds itself. And, I don't feel a lot of reticence talking openly about that.

        <p>
            Having done plenty of farming myself, I don't feel the need that so many others do to be extra nice to
            farmers out of lack of understanding. I know when the farmers complain about too little or too much rain,
            they are studiously ignoring the fact that if it is harder to plant or harvest, they make out like bandits
            with the price of their product. Farmers talk about how hard that life is, and yes, it is indeed very hard,
            but they seem to not mention that a typical large scale farm these days (as most farms are) is a multi tens
            of millions of dollars business sitting on enormously valuable land. Whenever things go really wrong with
            farms in the US, they get help. As it is now, we have some of the most bone-headed agricultural policies
            ever invented mainly to keep farmers happy, because so many US Congressional districts span vast farmland
            and little else.</p>
        <p>
            And what does America get back for giving farmers so much help in producing a product that we have no choice
            but to buy? We get a lot of crap. Red counties are farm counties. Red districts give us a Republican House.
            Farmers mainly backed trump, even though Trump policies are almost all bad for almost all farmers.
        </p>
        <p>As a brief aside, and to illustrate the disconnect between farmer culture and actual farmer self interest, I
            can give you this example</p>
        <p>
            Have you ever heard of Mexican cheese? Or, more to the point, have you ever been to Mexico, and then, while
            there, had some cheese? That cheese might have been made in Mexico, but they don't really make cheese in
            Mexico. Most of the cheese eaten there is imported. From where? From Wisconsin. Nowhere else. Why? Because
            of Clinton's trade policies. Clinton made a bunch of sweet deals for American farmers and that was one of
            them. Rural farmers in Wisconsin voted for Trump, and Trump was the guy who was going to end NAFTA (and
            still might, who knows?). </p>
        <p>
            NAFTA keeps Wisconsin dairy and cheese in business. Get rid of NAFTA, Wisconsin
            becomes the West Virginia of cheese. Why? Because Mexico would rather buy its cheese from South America
            because it is cheaper, and the moment the Wisconsin dairy industry is not propped up by NAFTA, the free
            market takes over and California ends Wisconsin agriculture. Have you ever heard of Mexican cheese? Or, more
            to the point, have you ever been to Mexico, and then, while there, had some cheese? That cheese might have
            been made in Mexico, but they don't really make cheese in Mexico. Most of the cheese eaten there is

        <p>Therefore, perhaps it will be with great pleasure that Modern Civilization advances to the next level. Robot
            farmers.</p>

        </p <p><strong>Hands Free Hectare</strong> is a project run by Harper Adams University and Precision Decisions
        Inc.
        The idea is to develop robots that will plant, tend, and harvest crops.
        Now, of course, there will still be farmers, but fewer. So few, perhaps, that most people who are all "oh,
        I'm a poor farmer, living out in the farmlands, help me help me," can stop whinging and move to the city. A
        small number of technologists, mostly the children of former Mexican migrant workers because immigrants or
        the children of recent immigrants or migrants are the only people in America who still have ambition, will
        learn the technology and run the farms and, we hope, keep the robots happy and busy.
        Anyway, HFHa, as it calls itself, has been at this a while, and the latest iteration involved a major
        harvest of barley without humans touching anything but buttons and software. HFHa robot expert Martin Abell
        working for Precision Decisions, noted “This project aimed to prove that there’s no technological reason why
        a field can’t be farmed without humans working the land directly now and we’ve done that. We achieved this
        on an impressively low budget [and] we used machinery that was readily available for farmers to buy; open
        source technology; and an autopilot from a drone for the navigation system.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Notably, much of the large equipment used was decades old, with the new technology added to it. </p>
        <p>
            Here is the site for <a href="http://www.handsfreehectare.com/">Free Hectare</a> , which is a British
            enterprise.</p>

        <p>I for one welcome our new farmer-robot overlords..

            It's a lesson that goes far beyond science, and can be applied to all areas of our lives. Imagine what the
            world could be like if we all did it.
